# Configuration
You can modify most of the parameters from the "CAM -> Config/Controller" page.
You can also enable (up to) 6-axis mode in Config section,
but bCNC restart is required for changes to take place.
Only the changes/differences from the default configuration
file will be saved in your home directory ${HOME}/.bCNC  or ~/.bCNC

The default configuration is stored on bCNC.ini in the
installation directory.
