# Debugging
You can log serial communication by changing the port to something like:

    spy:///dev/ttyUSB0?file=serial_log.txt&raw
    spy://COM1?file=serial_log.txt&raw

If a file isn't specified, the log is written to stderr.
The 'raw' option outputs the data directly, instead of creating a hex dump.
