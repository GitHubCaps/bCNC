# Documentation
An advanced fully [featured](FEATURES.md) g-code sender for grblHAL (formerly GRBL) for all your CNC needs. bCNC is a cross platform program (Windows, Linux, Mac) written in python. The sender is robust and fast able to work nicely with old or slow hardware like [Raspberry Pi](http://www.openbuilds.com/threads/bcnc-and-the-raspberry-pi.3038/) (As it was validated by the GRBL maintainer on heavy testing).
